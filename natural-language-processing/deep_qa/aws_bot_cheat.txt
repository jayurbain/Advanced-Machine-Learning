You can access my Stack Overflow Telegram Bot at @jxhsebot
PLEASE, if the bot is down or you want to ask any questions, ping me via Telegram at @jabdov
Bonus conversational features:
1) The chitchat bot has been trained to respond "what is your name" with its name. Other chitchat questions are responded from training with default English corpus. Some answers may look weird
2) For chitchat questions with low confidence matching, the LowConfidenceAdapter is used with threshold 0.5 and default response "I am sorry, but I do not understand." This has been done to reduce the number of weird answers to some questions which are very different from the training corpus.

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
